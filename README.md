## 🌐 About the Project
This is my personal **portfolio website**, built to showcase my work, skills, and interests. The main goal was to **learn and experiment with ReactJS and TailwindCSS**, while improving my **frontend development skills**. 

This project is a **work in progress**, and I plan to **iterate, refine, and add cool animations**—because, let's be honest, that's what everyone really cares about. 😉
